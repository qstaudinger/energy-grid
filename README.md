# Disparities in Network Charges and the Role of Harmonisation Measures

Network charges make up a substantial share of electricity prices and therefore
play an important role in the cost burden faced by households and industry. In
Germany, network charges differ widely across regions, mainly because renewable
generation is unevenly distributed and creates different grid expansion and manage
ment costs. To address these disparities, lawmakers introduced the Network Charge
Modernisation Act (Netzentgeltmodernisierungsgesetz) in 2016. The reform har
monised transmission-level network charges and gradually phased out avoided
network charges, which had previously been paid to decentralised generators as an
incentive.

This study examines developments since the law came into force in 2017. I compute
municipal-level network charges for all German municipalities and analyse their
evolution over time, focusing on changes in means and variances. Municipalities
are further grouped into regulatory areas to assess regional differences.
The results show clear redistribution effects across grid levels. Regions served by
previously high-cost transmission system operators experience declining charges,
while others face increases. However, contrary to expectations, the variance of
household network charges across Germany rises slightly over the period. While
the reform reduces disparities between regulatory areas (external variance), this
effect is offset by growing heterogeneity within regulatory areas (internal variance).
At the same time, I find a strong positive correlation between renewable energy
shares and network charges. Location therefore remains a key determinant of
network costs, with northern regions continuing to bear a disproportionate share
of the energy transition. Even though the reform did not reduce overall variance,
it likely prevented an even stronger increase. Moreover, its effects may extend
beyond 2023, as the ongoing phase-out of avoided network charges is expected to
influence network charges in the longer run
